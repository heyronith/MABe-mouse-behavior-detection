# 🏆 MABe Mouse Behavior Detection - Competition Solution

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/MABe-mouse-behavior-detection/blob/main/mabe_solution_colab_setup.ipynb)

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a **state-of-the-art solution** for the MABe Mouse Behavior Detection competition on Kaggle. The solution implements advanced temporal modeling techniques for multi-agent behavior recognition in mice, achieving superior performance through:

- **Phase 1**: Enhanced feature engineering with multi-scale windowing and adaptive smoothing
- **Phase 2**: Dual-branch architecture (TCN + Transformer) with cross-agent attention
- **Phase 3**: Domain generalization and self-supervised learning (planned)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Dual-Branch Temporal Model**
```
Input Features (64) → [Enhanced TCN] + [Temporal Transformer] → Fusion → Output (25 behaviors)
                      ↓ (0.5-2s)        ↓ (5-20s)
                Local Dynamics    Global Interactions
```

### **Key Innovations**
- **Multi-Scale Windowing**: 256, 512, 1024, 2048 frames covering 1-68 second behaviors
- **Adaptive Smoothing**: Quality-based algorithm selection (Savitzky-Golay, EMA, Butterworth, etc.)
- **Contact Heuristics**: 4 specialized interaction types (body, nose-body, head-head, tail)
- **Cross-Agent Attention**: Explicit multi-mouse interaction modeling
- **Temporal Consistency**: Loss function to reduce prediction flickering
